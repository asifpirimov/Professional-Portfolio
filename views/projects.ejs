            <h2>Project 2: Voice App - Pysis</h2>
            <p>
                Key features of the project:

Voice Recognition: The assistant listens for commands using Google Speech Recognition.
Speech Output: Using Google's text-to-speech (gTTS), the assistant speaks responses and deletes temporary audio files after playback.
Web Search: It can search the web based on voice input, opening a browser window with Google search results.
Real-Time Time Display: The assistant reports the current time in a conversational manner.
Exit Command: Users can easily terminate the program by saying commands like "quit" or "goodbye."
This project showcases a basic voice interaction system and can be expanded with more commands, enhanced speech recognition accuracy, and further integration with other APIs. It's ideal for demonstrating practical AI usage and creating hands-free applications for personal or professional use.
